# Melody-to-Vocals: Video Tutorial Script

A comprehensive script for creating video tutorials for the Melody-to-Vocals feature.

## Tutorial 1: Getting Started (3-4 minutes)

### Opening (0:00-0:15)

**[Screen: AI DAW logo/interface]**

**Narrator**: "Ever have a melody stuck in your head but struggle to find the right lyrics? With Melody-to-Vocals in AI DAW, you can transform any hummed melody into professional vocals with AI-generated lyrics in under a minute. Let me show you how."

### Section 1: What is Melody-to-Vocals? (0:15-0:45)

**[Screen: Feature overview with graphics showing the pipeline]**

**Narrator**: "Melody-to-Vocals uses advanced AI to turn your musical ideas into reality. Here's how it works:

First, you hum or sing a melody - even gibberish works.

Second, AI extracts the musical notes and rhythm from your recording.

Third, AI generates lyrics that match your melody's structure.

Finally, AI synthesizes professional vocals singing those lyrics.

The result? A complete vocal track in 30 to 60 seconds."

### Section 2: Recording Your Melody (0:45-1:30)

**[Screen: Recording interface/phone recording demo]**

**Narrator**: "Let's start by recording a melody. You can use any recording app - your phone's voice recorder, QuickTime on Mac, or the built-in recorder in AI DAW.

Here are some tips for the best results:

[Show: Person recording in quiet room]

Find a quiet space without background noise.

[Show: Person humming confidently into mic]

Hum or sing clearly and confidently - don't whisper.

[Show: Timer showing 10 seconds]

Keep it between 5 and 15 seconds - that's the sweet spot.

[Show: Person maintaining consistent distance from mic]

Maintain a consistent volume and distance from the microphone.

Don't worry about being perfectly on pitch - the AI can handle small variations.

[Show: Saved file named 'my_melody.wav']

Save your recording as a WAV or MP3 file."

### Section 3: Creating Your First Vocals (1:30-2:45)

**[Screen: AI DAW Melody-to-Vocals interface]**

**Narrator**: "Now let's generate vocals. Open the Melody-to-Vocals feature.

[Click upload button]

Upload your melody recording.

[Type in prompt field: 'A love song about summer nights']

Add a creative prompt describing what you want the song to be about. Be specific but concise. For example: 'A love song about summer nights.'

[Select genre: Pop]

Choose a genre - let's go with Pop.

[Optional fields shown]

You can also set a mood like 'nostalgic' and add a theme like 'romance', but these are optional.

[Hover over vocal model dropdown]

Choose your vocal model. Bark gives you clearer lyrics and is faster. MusicGen sounds more musical but takes longer. Let's use Bark for now.

[Click 'Generate Vocals' button]

Hit Generate Vocals and watch the magic happen."

### Section 4: Understanding Results (2:45-3:30)

**[Screen: Processing progress, then results]**

**Narrator**: "The AI is now working through three stages:

[Show: 'Extracting Melody' status]

Extracting the melody from your audio...

[Show: 'Generating Lyrics' status]

Generating lyrics that match the rhythm...

[Show: 'Synthesizing Vocals' status]

And synthesizing professional vocals.

[Show: Results screen with audio player and lyrics]

And there we have it! You can now play your vocal track, read the generated lyrics, and see details about your melody like the musical key and note range.

[Click download button]

Love the results? Download the MP3 file.

[Click regenerate button]

Want different lyrics? Hit regenerate to try again with the same melody."

## Tutorial 2: Advanced Tips & Techniques (5-6 minutes)

### Opening (0:00-0:20)

**[Screen: Professional-looking vocal waveforms]**

**Narrator**: "Ready to take your Melody-to-Vocals skills to the next level? In this tutorial, we'll explore advanced techniques, parameter combinations, and creative workflows that will help you get professional-quality results every time."

### Section 1: Writing Powerful Prompts (0:20-1:20)

**[Screen: Prompt examples with comparisons]**

**Narrator**: "Your prompt is the creative direction for your AI-generated lyrics. Let's compare good and bad prompts.

[Show weak prompt: 'Song']

Weak: 'Song' - way too vague.

[Show result: Generic, unfocused lyrics]

This gives unfocused, generic results.

[Show strong prompt: 'A heartfelt ballad about missing someone who moved away']

Strong: 'A heartfelt ballad about missing someone who moved away.'

[Show result: Specific, emotional lyrics]

Much better - specific, emotional, and focused.

Here's the formula: Combine emotion, subject, and a specific angle.

[Show formula graphic: Emotion + Subject + Specific Detail]

For example:
- 'An upbeat anthem about overcoming self-doubt'
- 'A nostalgic country song about growing up on a farm'
- 'An introspective indie track about finding yourself in a new city'

[Show: Character limit indicator]

Keep it 1-2 sentences. Too long overwhelms the AI, too short lacks direction."

### Section 2: Genre and Mood Combinations (1:20-2:30)

**[Screen: Genre/mood matrix with examples]**

**Narrator**: "Choosing the right genre and mood combination dramatically affects your results. Let's explore some powerful combinations.

[Play example: Pop + Happy]

Pop with a happy mood creates mainstream, uplifting tracks perfect for celebrations.

[Play example: Rock + Empowering]

Rock with an empowering mood delivers anthems of strength and perseverance.

[Play example: Folk + Nostalgic]

Folk with a nostalgic mood brings out intimate, reflective storytelling.

[Play example: Hip-Hop + Confident]

Hip-Hop with a confident mood generates modern, assertive lyrics.

[Show: Genre-specific tips overlay]

Pro tip: Match your melody's energy to your genre choice. A slow, gentle melody works better as folk or R&B than rock or hip-hop.

[Show: Mood mixing examples]

You can also combine moods: 'bittersweet', 'anxious but hopeful', 'peaceful yet melancholic'. The AI understands nuanced emotions."

### Section 3: Vocal Model Comparison (2:30-3:30)

**[Screen: Split-screen comparison]**

**Narrator**: "Let's compare the two vocal models side by side using the same melody and lyrics.

[Play: Bark version]

This is Bark - notice how clear and natural the pronunciation is. You can understand every word. It sounds more like spoken singing, perfect for ballads, pop, and R&B.

[Play: MusicGen version]

And this is MusicGen - hear how it follows the melody more closely? It sounds more musical and 'sung', but the lyrics are slightly less clear. Great for rock, country, and upbeat tracks where melody matters more than word clarity.

[Show: Decision flowchart]

Here's how to choose:

Clarity is priority? Use Bark.
Melody following is priority? Use MusicGen.
Slower song or ballad? Use Bark.
Upbeat or energetic? Try MusicGen.
Need it fast? Bark processes in half the time.

[Show: Hybrid workflow]

Pro workflow: Generate with both models and choose the best one, or use different models for verse and chorus."

### Section 4: Iterating and Refining (3:30-4:30)

**[Screen: Iteration workflow demonstration]**

**Narrator**: "Rarely is the first generation perfect. Here's how to iterate effectively.

[Show: First generation]

Start with your base prompt and standard settings.

[Play: First result]

Review the results. In this case, the lyrics are good but the mood feels off.

[Show: Adjusted mood parameter]

Adjust the mood from 'happy' to 'bittersweet' to better match the melody.

[Play: Second result]

Much better! The emotional tone now matches.

[Show: Genre exploration]

Try the same melody in different genres. Record once, generate multiple versions.

[Play: Pop version, Rock version, Country version side by side]

Same melody, three completely different interpretations. Pick the one that resonates.

[Show: Theme refinement]

Narrow your theme for more focused lyrics. Change 'love' to 'new love' or 'lost love' for different angles."

### Section 5: Creative Workflows (4:30-5:30)

**[Screen: Workflow diagrams]**

**Narrator**: "Let's explore some professional workflows.

[Show: Quick Demo workflow]

Workflow 1 - Quick Demo Creation:
Record verse melody, generate vocals, record chorus melody separately, generate chorus, combine in your DAW. Perfect for rapid songwriting sessions.

[Show: Genre Exploration workflow]

Workflow 2 - Genre Exploration:
Record one melody, generate in multiple genres, compare results, choose the best fit. Great when you're unsure which style suits your melody.

[Show: Lyric Brainstorming workflow]

Workflow 3 - Lyric Brainstorming:
Same melody, different prompts and themes. Generate multiple versions to overcome writer's block or explore different angles.

[Show: Building Blocks workflow]

Workflow 4 - Building Blocks:
Generate individual sections - intro, verse, pre-chorus, chorus, bridge - then assemble into a complete song. Gives you maximum control over structure."

### Closing (5:30-5:50)

**[Screen: Best results showcase]**

**Narrator**: "With these advanced techniques, you're ready to create professional-quality vocals from any melody. Remember: experiment fearlessly, iterate often, and let the AI surprise you. The more you use it, the better you'll understand how to guide it toward your vision. Happy creating!"

### Example 3: Nostalgic Folk Song (2:40-3:50)

**[Screen: Acoustic setting]**

**Narrator**: "Example three: A nostalgic folk song about memories.

[Show: Gentle, slow melody being hummed]

Gentle, introspective melody - slower pacing.

[Type prompt: 'Memories of growing up in a small town']

Prompt: 'Memories of growing up in a small town.'

[Select parameters: Genre: Folk, Mood: Nostalgic, Theme: Childhood, Style: John Denver, Model: Bark]

Folk genre, nostalgic mood, childhood theme. I'm adding a style reference - 'John Denver' - for that authentic folk storytelling approach. Back to Bark for this intimate style.

[Play: Result]

Beautiful - personal, narrative lyrics that feel like a genuine folk song. The reference to John Denver guided the AI toward that storytelling style.

[Show: Lyrics analysis]

Look at the imagery - 'old dirt road,' 'creek where we'd swim' - very folk, very nostalgic.
