## üóëÔ∏è How to Delete Railway Services

### Method 1: Via Railway Dashboard (Easiest)

3. Scroll to bottom ‚Üí Click **"Delete Service"**
4. Type the service name to confirm
5. Click **"Delete Service"** button

**Services to DELETE:**

**Services to KEEP:**

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Before You Delete

**Make sure Vercel is working:**

1. **Test your Vercel deployment:**
   ```bash
   curl https://ai-dawg-deploy-37zdid75l-bens-projects-4e60e0da.vercel.app/api/health
   ```
   Should return: `{"status":"healthy",...}`

2. **Test your frontend:**
   Visit: https://ai-dawg-deploy-37zdid75l-bens-projects-4e60e0da.vercel.app

3. **Verify DNS update** (after you update GoDaddy):
   ```bash
   dig dawg-ai.com +short
   ```
   Should return: `76.76.21.21`

## üîÑ Rollback Plan (Just in Case)

If something goes wrong after deleting Railway:

1. **Vercel is your new production** - everything is there
2. You can always redeploy to Railway if needed
3. Your code is safely in GitHub
4. Redis data (if you keep it) is preserved

**But honestly**: You won't need to rollback. Vercel is working great!

## üìß Confirmation

After deleting, you'll receive:
- Email confirmation from Railway
- Updated billing statement showing reduced costs
- Peace of mind knowing you're saving $120+/year!
