## üìÅ Files Modified

### Frontend (React/Vite)

**1. `/Users/benkennon/Projects_Archive/dawg/ai-dawg-deploy/src/ui/components/AIChatWidget.tsx`**
- **Lines 597-747**: Added `executeFunction()` helper to process all 11 routing functions
- **Lines 749-807**: Updated `sendMessage()` to execute AI function calls from text chat
- **Line 117**: Changed AI_BRAIN_URL from port 3100 ‚Üí 8002
- **Key Change**: Text chat now actually executes function calls (was previously broken)

**2. `/Users/benkennon/Projects_Archive/dawg/ai-dawg-deploy/src/ui/DAWDashboard.tsx`**
- **~Line 948**: Added 11 routing handler functions:
  - `handleGetTracks()`

  - `handleAICreateAudioTrack()`
  - `handleCreateSend()`
  - `handleRemoveSend()`
  - `handleSetSendLevel()`
  - `handleSetTrackOutput()`
  - `handleSetTrackVolume()`
  - `handleSetTrackPan()`
  - `handleMuteTrack()`
  - `handleSoloTrack()`
- **Lines 1723-1734**: All handlers passed to AIChatWidget as props

- Same routing functions as text chat, but for voice control

### State Management

**5. `/Users/benkennon/Projects_Archive/dawg/ai-dawg-deploy/src/stores/timelineStore.ts`**
- No changes (already had routing infrastructure with Send interface, track types, etc.)

### Documentation

**6. `/Users/benkennon/Projects_Archive/dawg/ai-dawg-deploy/AI_ROUTING_TEST_GUIDE.md`**
- Comprehensive testing guide with example commands
- Architecture flow diagrams

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Changes

### Server Port Configuration (CRITICAL FIX)

**Problem**: Both `ai-brain-server.ts` and `realtime-voice-server.ts` were using port 3100, causing conflicts.

**Solution**:
- `ai-brain-server.ts` ‚Üí **Port 8002** (text chat with /api/chat endpoint)
- `realtime-voice-server.ts` ‚Üí **Port 3100** (live voice via WebSocket)

**Environment Variable**: Set `AI_BRAIN_PORT=8002` in Railway environment

### Text Chat Function Execution (CRITICAL FIX)

**Problem**: Text chat received function calls from OpenAI API but didn't execute them.

**Solution**: Added `executeFunction()` in AIChatWidget that:
1. Receives function call from AI response
2. Matches function name to appropriate handler
3. Executes the function with parsed arguments
4. Shows toast notification to user
5. Returns result to chat

### AI System Prompt Enhancement

**Added Logic Pro X Knowledge**:
- How to create aux tracks for effects routing
- Pre-fader vs post-fader sends
- Professional mixing workflows (reverb buses, parallel compression)
- Smart send level recommendations (vocals: 20-30%, instruments: 10-20%)
- Headphone mix setup with pre-fader sends

## üöÄ Deployment Details

### Git Repository
- **Remote**: https://github.com/kennonjarvis-debug/ai-dawg-deploy.git
- **Branch**: master
- **Latest Commit**: `432ccc0` - "Add Logic Pro X-style AI routing integration"

### Railway Deployment
- **Project**: dazzling-happiness
- **Environment**: production
- **Service**: dawg-ai-backend
- **Deployment Method**: `railway up --detach`
- **Dockerfile**: Uses existing Dockerfile
- **Start Command**: `sh start.sh` (determined by SERVICE_TYPE env var)

### Required Environment Variables

**Production Deployment** requires these env vars in Railway:

```bash
# OpenAI API Key (required for AI features)
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...

# Server Ports
AI_BRAIN_PORT=8002        # Text chat server
PORT=3100                 # Realtime voice server (default)

# Service Type (for Railway multi-service setup)
SERVICE_TYPE=ai-brain     # Determines which server to run
```

### Services Architecture

Railway should have **TWO separate services**:

1. **AI Brain Service** (Text Chat)
   - `SERVICE_TYPE=ai-brain`
   - Port: 8002
   - Handles: `/api/chat` endpoint
   - File: `src/backend/ai-brain-server.ts`

2. **Realtime Voice Service** (Voice Chat)
   - `SERVICE_TYPE=voice` (needs to be added to start.sh if not exists)
   - Port: 3100
   - Handles: WebSocket voice connections
   - File: `src/backend/realtime-voice-server.ts`

---

## üìä Production URLs

### Frontend
- **Production URL**: TBD (check Railway dashboard)
- **Local Dev**: http://localhost:5173

### Backend Services
- **Main Backend**: Port 3001
- **AI Brain (Text Chat)**: Port 8002
- **Realtime Voice**: Port 3100
- **Gateway**: TBD

---

## üß™ Testing in Production

Once deployed, test these commands in production:

### Text Chat Commands

1. **"Create a stereo aux track called Reverb"**
   - Should create new aux track
   - Toast notification appears
   - Track visible in timeline

2. **"Set up a professional vocal chain"**
   - AI creates Reverb + Delay aux tracks
   - Routes vocals intelligently
   - Sets appropriate send levels

3. **"Show me all tracks in this project"**
   - AI lists all tracks with routing info

### Voice Chat Commands

1. Click microphone
2. Say: **"Create a delay bus for the guitar"**
3. AI should create aux track and routing

## üîç Debugging Production Issues

### Check Logs

**Railway Dashboard**:
```
https://railway.com/project/cfe8b20f-10c5-40f6-a612-70a7f1cbc1ad
```

**Look for**:
```
üß† AI Brain server running on port 8002
‚úÖ OpenAI API key configured - Live voice features enabled
```

### Common Issues

**1. Function calls not executing**
- Check: Is OPENAI_API_KEY set in Railway?
- Check: Is AI_BRAIN_PORT=8002 set?
- Check: Browser console for function call logs

**2. Port conflicts**
- Verify: ai-brain-server on 8002
- Verify: realtime-voice-server on 3100
- Check: Railway service configuration

**3. Missing routing functions**
- Verify: Latest commit (432ccc0) is deployed
- Check: Build logs for errors
- Verify: All 5 modified files are included in build

### Health Check

**Production Health Endpoint**:
```bash
curl https://[your-railway-url]/health
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-18T...",
  "services": {
    "ai_brain": "running",
    "realtime_voice": "running"
  }
}
```

- Backend: Port 3001
- AI Brain: Port 8002
- Realtime Voice: Port 3100

**Production (Railway)**:
- All services deployed via Docker
- Ports configured via environment variables
- Static assets served from dist/

### Key Interfaces

**Track Interface** (`src/stores/timelineStore.ts`):
```typescript
interface Track {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  trackType: 'audio' | 'midi' | 'aux';
  channels: 'mono' | 'stereo';
  sends: Send[];
  outputDestination: string; // 'master' or aux track ID
  volume: number;
  pan: number;
  isMuted: boolean;
  isSolo: boolean;
  // ...
}
```

**Send Interface**:
```typescript
interface Send {
  id: string;
  destination: string; // aux track ID
  level: number; // 0-1
  pan: number; // -1 to 1
  preFader: boolean;
  enabled: boolean;
}
```

### Working with Routing

**To add new routing features**:
1. Update function definitions in `ai-brain-server.ts` DAW_FUNCTIONS array
2. Add handler in `DAWDashboard.tsx`
3. Pass handler to `AIChatWidget` as prop
4. Add case in `executeFunction()` switch statement
5. Update AI SYSTEM_PROMPT with usage examples
