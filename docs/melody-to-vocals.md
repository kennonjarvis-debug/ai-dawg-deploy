## How It Works

The Melody-to-Vocals feature uses a 3-stage AI pipeline:

### Stage 1: Pitch Extraction (CREPE)

**What happens**: Your audio is analyzed to extract the melody

- **Technology**: CREPE (Convolutional REpresentation for Pitch Estimation) - a state-of-the-art neural network
- **Process**:
  1. Audio is resampled to 16kHz
  2. CREPE analyzes the waveform in small windows
  3. Pitch values are extracted (in Hz)
  4. Frequencies are converted to musical notes (C4, D4, etc.)
  5. Song key is estimated from pitch histogram

- **Output**: Structured melody data including notes, timing, key, and range
- **Time**: ~1-2 seconds (runs locally)

**Example Output**:
```json
{
  "num_notes": 24,
  "duration": 8.5,
  "key": "C",
  "range": "C4 to G4",
  "notes": ["C4", "D4", "E4", "F4", "G4", "F4", "E4", "D4"]
}
```

### Stage 2: Lyric Generation (Claude AI / GPT-4)

**What happens**: AI writes lyrics that match your melody's structure

- **Technology**: Claude AI (Anthropic) or GPT-4 (OpenAI) - advanced language models
- **Process**:
  1. Melody structure is analyzed (phrase length, rhythm)
  2. Syllable count is estimated per phrase
  3. Your prompt, genre, mood, and theme are incorporated
  4. AI generates lyrics matching the melody's cadence
  5. Lyrics are formatted to align with musical phrases

- **Output**: Complete lyrics with proper phrasing
- **Time**: ~3-5 seconds (API call)

**Example Output**:
```
Under the stars, we danced so free
Summer nights, just you and me
Moonlight glow on your face so bright
Lost in love on a summer night
```

### Stage 3: Vocal Synthesis (Bark or MusicGen)

**What happens**: Lyrics are performed as a vocal track

You can choose between two synthesis models:

#### Option A: Bark (Recommended for clarity)
- **Type**: Text-to-Speech AI
- **Strengths**: Clear pronunciation, natural speech patterns
- **Best for**: Pop, R&B, ballads, spoken-word sections
- **Processing time**: ~20-30 seconds
- **Model**: `pollinations/bark` on Replicate

#### Option B: MusicGen-Melody (Recommended for singing)
- **Type**: Music generation AI with melody conditioning
- **Strengths**: More musical, follows melody closely
- **Best for**: Rock, country, upbeat songs
- **Processing time**: ~40-60 seconds
- **Model**: `meta/musicgen:melody` on Replicate

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Record Your Melody

    }

    response = requests.post(url, files=files, data=data)
    result = response.json()

print(result['lyrics'])
print(result['audio_url'])
```

### Step 4: Review Your Results

The response includes:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "audio_url": "https://replicate.delivery/pbxt/...",
  "lyrics": "Rising up from where I've been...",
  "melody_info": {
    "num_notes": 32,

    "notes": ["G3", "A3", "B3", ...]
  },
  "lyrics_info": {
    "num_lines": 8,
    "syllables": 48,
    "genre": "pop",
    "theme": "personal growth",
    "mood": "uplifting"
  },
  "processing_steps": [
    "Extracted 32 notes from melody",
    "Generated 8 lines of lyrics",
    "Synthesized vocals using bark"
  ]
}
```

#### What to Check

1. **Audio quality**: Download and listen to the vocal track
2. **Lyric accuracy**: Ensure lyrics match your prompt and melody
3. **Melody match**: Verify the vocals follow your original melody

## Best Practices

### Recording Your Melody

#### DO:
- Record in a quiet room
- Hum/sing at normal conversational volume
- Stay consistent with your pitch (even if imperfect)
- Record 5-15 seconds for best results
- Use mono recording (not stereo)
- Keep phone/mic at consistent distance

#### DON'T:
- Record in noisy environments
- Whisper or shout
- Move around while recording
- Record for too long (>30 seconds)
- Use heavy effects or filters
- Record with background music playing

### Writing Effective Prompts

#### Strong Prompts:
```
✓ "A heartfelt ballad about missing someone who moved away"
✓ "An empowering anthem for someone starting over after a breakup"
✓ "A nostalgic summer song about teenage adventures"
✓ "An introspective song about finding yourself in a new city"
```

#### Weak Prompts:
```
✗ "Love song"
✗ "Make it emotional and catchy and meaningful"
✗ "A song"
✗ [3 paragraph story]
```

**Formula**: `[Emotion/style] + [subject/topic] + [specific angle/detail]`

### Choosing Parameters

#### Start Simple:
```javascript
{
  prompt: "A love song about summer nights",
  genre: "pop",
  mood: "nostalgic"
}
```

#### Add Details as Needed:
```javascript
{
  prompt: "A love song about summer nights by the beach",
  genre: "indie folk",
  mood: "bittersweet",
  theme: "lost love",
  style: "Jack Johnson",
  vocal_model: "bark"
}
```

#### Don't Over-specify:
Too many constraints can limit AI creativity. Find balance.

   - Ensure original recording is clean
   - Try shorter duration

3. **If lyrics are off-topic**:
   - Make prompt more specific
   - Add theme parameter
   - Try different AI provider

4. **If processing fails**:
   - Check audio file format
   - Verify file size < 10MB
   - Ensure melody is audible/clear
   - Check server logs

See your face in the sunset, frozen in time
Though we've grown and moved on, gone our separate ways
Part of me still lives in those golden days

No chains can hold me, I'm finally me
Watch me soar, watch me fly
I'm reaching for the sky

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Could not extract clear melody"

**Symptoms**: Error message, no melody data returned

**Causes**:
- Audio is too quiet or noisy
- No clear pitch detected (background noise)
- File format unsupported
- Melody is too short or too long

**Solutions**:
1. Re-record in a quieter environment
2. Hum louder and more clearly
3. Check audio file plays correctly
4. Try WAV format instead of MP3
5. Ensure melody is 5-30 seconds long
6. Remove background music/noise

#### "API timeout" / Long processing time

**Symptoms**: Request takes very long or times out

**Causes**:
- Replicate models are busy
- Network connectivity issues
- Very long melody file

**Solutions**:
1. Wait and retry in a few minutes
2. Use shorter melody (10-15 seconds)
3. Check internet connection
4. Try during off-peak hours
5. Switch to "bark" (faster than musicgen)

#### "No API key found"

**Symptoms**: Error about missing API credentials

**Causes**:
- Environment variables not set
- API keys not configured

**Solutions**:
1. Add to `.env` file:
   ```
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-api03-...
   REPLICATE_API_TOKEN=r8_...
   ```
2. Restart the server
3. Verify keys are valid
4. Check key hasn't expired

#### Lyrics don't match melody rhythm

**Symptoms**: Vocals feel off-beat or awkward

**Causes**:
- Melody too complex or irregular
- Syllable estimation incorrect
- Melody unclear to AI

**Solutions**:
1. Hum more clearly with consistent rhythm
2. Try simpler melody pattern
3. Use shorter melody duration
4. Try different genre (some fit better)
5. Manually adjust lyrics after generation

#### Vocals sound robotic or unclear

**Symptoms**: Unnatural sounding voice, hard to understand

**Causes**:
- Using musicgen for ballad/slow song
- Poor quality input audio
- Lyrics too complex

**Solutions**:
1. Switch to "bark" vocal model
2. Use simpler, clearer prompts
3. Record melody more cleanly
4. Try different genre setting

#### Wrong mood/theme in lyrics

**Symptoms**: Lyrics don't match your creative vision

**Causes**:
- Vague prompt
- Conflicting parameters
- AI interpretation differs

**Solutions**:
1. Make prompt more specific
2. Add explicit mood and theme parameters
3. Try different AI provider
4. Include reference style
5. Iterate with refined prompt

### Error Codes

### API Costs

**Per request** (approximate):
- Pitch extraction: Free (local)
- Lyric generation (Claude): ~$0.01
- Lyric generation (GPT-4): ~$0.02
- Bark synthesis: ~$0.03-0.05
- MusicGen synthesis: ~$0.07-0.10

**Total per song**: $0.04 - $0.12

Much cheaper than alternatives like Suno API!

### Data Privacy

- Audio files are processed locally for pitch extraction
- Files sent to Replicate for synthesis are temporary
- Lyrics are generated via API (encrypted in transit)
- No data is permanently stored on external servers
- Check individual API provider policies for details

### Limitations

1. **Melody complexity**: Very complex melodies may not extract perfectly
2. **Background noise**: Noisy recordings degrade results
3. **Language**: Currently optimized for English lyrics
4. **Duration**: Best results with 5-15 second melodies
5. **Vocal range**: Synthesis models have limited range
6. **Real-time**: Not suitable for live performance (30-70s latency)

### Future Enhancements

Planned improvements:
- Multi-language support
- Real-time streaming
- Voice cloning integration
- MIDI export option
- Harmony generation
- Verse/chorus structure detection
