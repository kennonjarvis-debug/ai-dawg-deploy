**User:** "Yes, fix them"

**DAWG AI:** "Analyzing failures and generating fixes..."

*[Auto-fix suggestions displayed]*

## Command Patterns

### Natural Language Support

The testing agent understands natural variations:

**Direct Commands:**
- "Run tests"
- "Test everything"
- "Execute all tests"

**Conversational:**
- "Can you run the tests for me?"
- "Hey DAWG, test the application"
- "I'd like to run all tests please"

**Contextual:**
- "Test it" (after discussing a feature)
- "Run those" (after listing test files)
- "Check that workflow" (after mentioning it)

### Multi-Command Sequences

Chain commands together:

**User:** "Run all tests, and if anything fails, fix it automatically"

**DAWG AI:** *Executes both commands in sequence*

**User:** "Create a test for login, then run it, then show me coverage"

**DAWG AI:** *Executes all three commands*

---

## Response Times

Typical command execution times:

| Command | Expected Duration |
|---------|------------------|
| Run All Tests | 2-5 minutes |
| Run Workflow Tests | 30-90 seconds |
| Single Test | 5-30 seconds |
| Create Test | 10-30 seconds |
| Fix Tests | 20-60 seconds |
| Show Report | Instant |

---

## Error Handling

### Command Not Recognized

**User:** "Do the test thing"

**DAWG AI:** "I'm not sure which test operation you want. You can:
- Run all tests
- Run workflow tests
- Test a specific feature
- Create a new test
- Fix failing tests
- Show test report

Which would you like?"

### Insufficient Permissions

**User:** "Run all tests"

**DAWG AI:** "I need admin privileges to run tests. Please contact your administrator to grant access."

### Test Execution Failed

**User:** "Run all tests"

**DAWG AI:** "Test execution encountered an error: Test framework not found. Please ensure Playwright is installed."

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Be Specific**: "Test the checkout workflow" is better than "test something"

2. **Use Feature Names**: Reference features by their actual names in the codebase

3. **Provide Context**: "I just updated the login page, test it" helps the AI focus

4. **Approve Fixes Carefully**: Review auto-fix suggestions before approving

5. **Check Reports**: Use "show test report" to track progress over time

6. **Create Tests Early**: Generate tests while building features for better coverage

---

## Keyboard Shortcuts (Test Control Panel)

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Ctrl+T` | Run all tests |
| `Ctrl+W` | Run workflow tests |
| `Ctrl+F` | Fix failing tests |
| `Ctrl+R` | Show report |
| `Ctrl+C` | Cancel running tests |

---

## Integration with Chat

All test commands work seamlessly in the chat interface:

1. **Voice Input**: Speak commands naturally
2. **Text Input**: Type commands in chat
3. **Button Triggers**: Click quick action buttons
4. **Context Aware**: AI remembers conversation context
