## Quick Commands

### Run All Transport Tests
```bash
# Unit tests (fastest)
npm run test -- tests/unit/transportStore.test.ts

# Integration tests
npm run test -- tests/integration/multiTrackRecording.test.ts

# E2E tests (slowest but most comprehensive)
npx playwright test tests/e2e/transport-bar-recording.spec.ts
```

### Run Specific Test Groups

```bash
# Basic button tests
npx playwright test tests/e2e/transport-bar-recording.spec.ts -g "Basic Transport"

# State transition tests
npx playwright test tests/e2e/transport-bar-recording.spec.ts -g "State Transitions"

# Recording lifecycle tests
npx playwright test tests/e2e/transport-bar-recording.spec.ts -g "Recording Lifecycle"

# Edge case tests
npx playwright test tests/e2e/transport-bar-recording.spec.ts -g "Edge Cases"
```

### Debug Tests

```bash
# Run with browser visible
npx playwright test tests/e2e/transport-bar-recording.spec.ts --headed

# Run with Playwright Inspector
npx playwright test tests/e2e/transport-bar-recording.spec.ts --debug

# Run in slow motion
npx playwright test tests/e2e/transport-bar-recording.spec.ts --headed --slowmo=1000
```

## Test Coverage Summary

### E2E Tests (30 tests)
- ✅ Play/Stop/Record button functionality
- ✅ State transitions (stopped ↔ playing ↔ recording)
- ✅ Recording lifecycle (start/stop/clip creation)
- ✅ Visual feedback and UI updates
- ✅ Edge cases (double-clicks, rapid clicks)
- ✅ Recording with/without tracks
- ✅ Transport state persistence
- ✅ Audio permissions handling

### Unit Tests (80 tests)
- ✅ All playback controls
- ✅ All recording controls
- ✅ BPM management (validation)
- ✅ Time management
- ✅ Loop controls
- ✅ Transport navigation
- ✅ Time signature
- ✅ Musical key
- ✅ Master volume
- ✅ Punch recording
- ✅ Recording aids (pre-roll, post-roll, count-in)
- ✅ Metronome
- ✅ Time calculations
- ✅ Store reset

### Integration Tests (20 tests)
- ✅ Hook initialization
- ✅ Recording state management
- ✅ Multi-track recording
- ✅ Microphone access
- ✅ Audio context management
- ✅ Resource cleanup

## Key Features Tested

### 1. Basic Transport Controls
```typescript
// Tests verify:
- Play button starts playback
- Pause button pauses playback
- Stop button stops and resets
- Record button starts recording
```

### 2. State Transitions
```typescript
// All transitions tested:
Stopped → Playing
Playing → Stopped
Stopped → Recording
Recording → Stopped
Playing → Paused → Playing
```

### 3. Recording Functionality
```typescript
// Comprehensive recording tests:
- Start recording
- Stop recording
- Record multiple tracks
- Record with armed tracks only
- Handle no armed tracks
- Exclude aux tracks
- Create clips after recording
```

### 4. Edge Cases
```typescript
// Stress tests included:
- Double-clicking buttons
- Rapid button presses
- Clicking stop while starting
- Race conditions
- Permission handling
```

### 5. Visual Feedback
```typescript
// UI state validation:
- Button active states
- Recording indicators
- Waveform preview
- Time display updates
- BPM display
```

## Example Test Runs

### Successful Test Output
```
✓ Play button should exist and be clickable
✓ Stop button should exist and be clickable
✓ Record button should exist and be clickable
✓ Transition: Stopped → Playing
✓ Transition: Playing → Stopped
✓ Transition: Stopped → Recording
✓ Recording starts when Record button is pressed
✓ Recording stops when Stop button is pressed
✓ Double-clicking Play button should not cause errors
✓ Recording without armed tracks shows warning

30 passed (2m 45s)
```

### Failed Test Example
```
❌ Recording stops when Stop button is pressed
   Expected recording to stop but isRecording = true
   Screenshot: /tmp/transport-recording-failed-1234.png
```

## Debugging Failed Tests

### 1. Check Screenshots
```bash
# View screenshots in /tmp/
ls -lt /tmp/transport-*.png | head -10
```

### 2. Run Single Test
```bash
npx playwright test tests/e2e/transport-bar-recording.spec.ts -g "specific test name"
```

### 3. Use Headed Mode
```bash
npx playwright test tests/e2e/transport-bar-recording.spec.ts --headed
```

### 4. Check Console Logs
Tests automatically log important events:
```
✅ DAW setup complete
✅ Play button found with selector: [data-testid="play-button"]
✅ Play button clicked successfully
✅ Successfully transitioned from Stopped to Playing
```

## CI/CD Integration

### Add to GitHub Actions
```yaml
- name: Run Transport Tests
  run: |
    npm run test -- tests/unit/transportStore.test.ts
    npm run test -- tests/integration/multiTrackRecording.test.ts
    npx playwright test tests/e2e/transport-bar-recording.spec.ts
```

### Add to Pre-commit Hook
```bash
npm run test -- tests/unit/transportStore.test.ts
```

## Performance

### Execution Times
- Unit tests: ~5 seconds
- Integration tests: ~10 seconds
- E2E tests: ~3 minutes (full suite)
- E2E tests: ~30 seconds (single test)

### Optimization
- Run unit tests during development (fastest feedback)
- Run E2E tests before commits
- Use `--grep` to run specific tests
- Use `--headed` only when debugging

## Next Steps

1. **Run the tests:**
   ```bash
   npx playwright test tests/e2e/transport-bar-recording.spec.ts
   ```

2. **Review results:**
   ```bash
   npx playwright show-report
   ```

3. **Add to CI/CD pipeline**

4. **Customize for your needs:**
   - Update selectors in `transport-helpers.ts`
   - Add new test cases
   - Modify timeouts for slower environments
