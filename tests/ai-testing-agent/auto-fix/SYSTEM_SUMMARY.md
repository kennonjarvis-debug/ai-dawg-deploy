## Real-World Example: Music Generation Test Failure

### Scenario

A test fails in the DAWG AI voice-to-music feature:

```typescript
Test: "should generate music from voice command"
File: tests/e2e/voice-to-music.spec.ts
Error: Timeout 5000ms exceeded waiting for WebSocket response
```

### System Workflow

#### 1. Failure Detection & Analysis (fix-generator.ts)

```typescript
// System analyzes the failure
{
  testName: "should generate music from voice command",
  errorMessage: "Timeout 5000ms exceeded",
  failureType: "timeout",
  rootCause: "WebSocket timeout (5s) insufficient for music generation (10-15s)"
}
```

**GPT-4o Analysis:**
- Identifies timeout as root cause
- Searches agent brain for similar WebSocket timeout fixes
- Finds 2 similar past fixes with successful outcomes

#### 2. Fix Generation (fix-generator.ts)

The system generates 3 fix options:

**Option 1: Quick Fix (Recommended)**
- Description: "Increase WebSocket timeout to 30 seconds"
- Confidence: 85%
- Complexity: Low
- Breaking Change: No
- Files: `tests/e2e/voice-to-music.spec.ts`

**Option 2: Robust Fix**
- Description: "Add retry logic with exponential backoff"
- Confidence: 75%
- Complexity: Medium
- Breaking Change: No
- Files: `tests/e2e/voice-to-music.spec.ts`, `tests/helpers/websocket-helper.ts`

**Option 3: Architectural Fix**
- Description: "Refactor to polling-based status check"
- Confidence: 60%
- Complexity: High
- Breaking Change: Yes
- Files: Multiple files

**System selects Option 1** (highest confidence, lowest complexity)

#### 3. Fix Application & Validation (fix-validator.ts)

```typescript
// Apply the fix
const changes = [
  {
    file: "tests/e2e/voice-to-music.spec.ts",
    changeType: "modify",
    oldContent: "await page.waitForSelector('.music-generated', { timeout: 5000 });",
    newContent: "await page.waitForSelector('.music-generated', { timeout: 30000 });"
  }
];

// Validate
const result = {
  success: true,
  allPassed: true,
  passed: 12,
  failed: 0,
  total: 12,
  confidence: 0.875,
  duration: 45300
};
```

**Validation Steps:**
1. ✅ Original test now passes (12.5s execution)
2. ✅ All 11 related tests pass
3. ✅ No new failures introduced
4. ✅ Performance acceptable (within expected range)

#### 4. PR Creation (pr-creator.ts)

**Branch Created:**
```

# [AUTO-FIX] Fix failing test: should generate music from voice command

## Summary

This PR contains an automated fix generated by the DAWG AI Testing Agent for a failing test. The fix has been analyzed, generated, and validated using GPT-4o.

**Test:** `should generate music from voice command`
**File:** `tests/e2e/voice-to-music.spec.ts`
**Fix Confidence:** 87.5%
**Validation Status:** ✅ PASSED

---

## Test Failure Analysis

### Error Details

```
Timeout 5000ms exceeded waiting for WebSocket response
Expected: music generation complete
Actual: timeout waiting for .music-generated selector
```

### Root Cause

**Category:** timeout
**Severity:** high

The test is failing because the WebSocket connection timeout (5 seconds) is insufficient for the music generation service to process voice input and generate music. Analysis shows that music generation typically takes 10-15 seconds, with the AI model processing taking 8-12 seconds and audio synthesis taking an additional 2-3 seconds.

The current timeout of 5000ms was appropriate for simple chat responses but doesn't account for the longer processing time required for music generation.

### Stack Trace

```
TimeoutError: waiting for selector ".music-generated" failed: timeout 5000ms exceeded
    at tests/e2e/voice-to-music.spec.ts:45:23
    at processTicksAndRejections (node:internal/process/task_queues:95:5)
```

---

## Fix Strategy

### Recommended Approach

Increase the WebSocket timeout to 30 seconds to accommodate the actual music generation time.

**Reasoning:** Analysis of production logs shows that 95% of music generation requests complete within 18 seconds. A 30-second timeout provides adequate buffer while still catching genuine failures. This is a minimal-risk change that only affects test timeout values.

**Complexity:** low
**Breaking Change:** No
**Estimated Impact:** Improves test reliability without affecting production behavior. Expected to eliminate false negatives from this test.

### Files Changed

- `tests/e2e/voice-to-music.spec.ts` (modify): Increase timeout from 5s to 30s

### Alternative Approaches Considered

**Option 2: Add retry logic with exponential backoff**
- Confidence: 75%
- Complexity: medium
- Reasoning: More robust but adds complexity for limited benefit

**Option 3: Refactor to polling-based status check**
- Confidence: 60%
- Complexity: high
- Reasoning: More architectural change, potential breaking changes
