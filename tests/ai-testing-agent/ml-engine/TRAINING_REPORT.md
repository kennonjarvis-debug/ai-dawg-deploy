### Analysis of Results

#### Top Performers (>80% Accuracy)
1. **Melody-to-Vocals (83.33%)** - Excellent balanced performance with good precision and recall
2. **AI Mastering (90.91%)** - Highest accuracy but precision/recall need improvement

#### Good Performers (65-80% Accuracy)
3. **AI Memory (77.27%)** - Solid accuracy, workable for production
4. **Freestyle (66.67%)** - Very high recall (94.74%), good for catching failures

#### Needs Improvement (<65% Accuracy)
5. **Stem Separation (63.64%)** - Borderline, could benefit from more training data
6. **Voice Commands (59.09%)** - Needs feature engineering or more data
7. **Budget Alerts (59.09%)** - Requires rebalancing of training data
8. **Live Vocal Analysis (54.55%)** - Lowest performer, needs redesign

### Why Some Models Show 0% Precision/Recall

Several models show 0% precision and recall despite reasonable accuracy. This indicates:
- **Class Imbalance:** Model predicting all samples as one class (likely "no failure")
- **Threshold Issues:** Decision boundary needs adjustment
- **Feature Correlation:** Features may not be sufficiently discriminative

**Recommended Fixes:**
1. Increase training data for minority class (failures)
2. Implement class weighting or SMOTE oversampling
3. Adjust decision threshold from 0.5 to optimal value
4. Add more discriminative features
5. Try ensemble methods (Random Forest, XGBoost)

## Usage Guide

### 1. Making Predictions

```typescript
import { getWorkflowPredictor } from './ml-engine/workflow-predictors';
import type { FreestyleFeatures } from './ml-engine/workflow-features';

// Initialize predictor (once at startup)
const predictor = await getWorkflowPredictor();

// Prepare features
const features: FreestyleFeatures = {
  workflowType: 'freestyle',
  timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),

  // Common features
  networkLatencyMs: 150,
  apiAvailable: true,
  userConcurrency: 5,
  systemMemoryMB: 8192,
  cpuUtilization: 0.45,
  timeOfDay: new Date().getHours(),
  dayOfWeek: new Date().getDay(),
  isWeekend: [0, 6].includes(new Date().getDay()),

  // Workflow-specific features
  microphonePermission: true,
  audioContextState: 'running',
  sampleRate: 48000,
  recordingDuration: 0,
  beatSyncEnabled: true,
  beatFileSize: 5000000,
  speechRecognitionSupported: true,
  transcriptionAccuracy: 0.85,
  voiceCommandsEnabled: true,
  commandRecognitionRate: 0.9,
  currentTakeNumber: 1,
  totalTakes: 0,
  audioChunksCount: 0,
  lyricsSegmentsCount: 0,
  previousTranscriptionFailures: 0,
  previousAudioUploadFailures: 0,
  previousBeatSyncIssues: 0,
};

// Get prediction
const prediction = await predictor.predict(features);

console.log(`Failure Probability: ${(prediction.failureProbability * 100).toFixed(1)}%`);
console.log(`Risk Level: ${prediction.riskLevel}`);
console.log(`Confidence: ${(prediction.confidence * 100).toFixed(1)}%`);
console.log(`\nTop Risk Factors:`);
prediction.criticalFactors.forEach((factor, i) => {
  console.log(`  ${i + 1}. ${factor.feature}: ${factor.value.toFixed(2)} (weight: ${factor.weight.toFixed(2)})`);
});
console.log(`\nRecommendations:`);
prediction.recommendations.forEach((rec, i) => {
  console.log(`  ${i + 1}. ${rec}`);
});
```

### 2. Integrating into Test Suite

```typescript
import { getWorkflowPredictor } from './ml-engine/workflow-predictors';

describe('Freestyle Recording Workflow', () => {
  let predictor;

  beforeAll(async () => {
    predictor = await getWorkflowPredictor();
  });

  it('should detect high-risk scenarios before execution', async () => {
    // Simulate risky conditions
    const riskyFeatures = {
      workflowType: 'freestyle',
      microphonePermission: false, // HIGH RISK
      audioContextState: 'suspended', // HIGH RISK
      transcriptionAccuracy: 0.4, // LOW ACCURACY
      previousTranscriptionFailures: 8, // MANY FAILURES
      // ... other features
    };

    const prediction = await predictor.predict(riskyFeatures);

    expect(prediction.riskLevel).toBeOneOf(['high', 'critical']);
    expect(prediction.failureProbability).toBeGreaterThan(0.7);

    // Skip test or add extra error handling based on prediction
    if (prediction.riskLevel === 'critical') {
      console.warn('Skipping test due to critical risk prediction');
      return;
    }
  });

  it('should provide actionable recommendations', async () => {
    const prediction = await predictor.predict(features);

    expect(prediction.recommendations).toBeInstanceOf(Array);
    expect(prediction.recommendations.length).toBeGreaterThan(0);

    // Apply recommendations programmatically
    prediction.recommendations.forEach(rec => {
      applyRecommendation(rec);
    });
  });
});
```

### 3. Monitoring in Production

```typescript
import { getWorkflowPredictor } from './ml-engine/workflow-predictors';

class WorkflowMonitor {
  private predictor;

  async initialize() {
    this.predictor = await getWorkflowPredictor();
  }

  async checkBeforeExecution(workflow, features) {
    const prediction = await this.predictor.predict(features);

    // Log predictions for analysis
    logger.info('Workflow prediction', {
      workflow: prediction.workflowType,
      probability: prediction.failureProbability,
      risk: prediction.riskLevel,
      confidence: prediction.confidence,
    });

    // Take action based on risk level
    switch (prediction.riskLevel) {
      case 'critical':
        // Block execution and alert
        alertOps('Critical workflow risk detected');
        throw new Error('Workflow blocked due to critical risk');

      case 'high':
        // Enable extra monitoring and error handling
        enableDetailedLogging();
        enableRetryLogic();
        break;

      case 'medium':
        // Add warnings
        showUserWarning(prediction.recommendations);
        break;

      case 'low':
        // Proceed normally
        break;
    }

    return prediction;
  }
}
```
