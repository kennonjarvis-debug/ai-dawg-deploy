## Quick Facts

| Aspect | Finding |
|--------|---------|
| **Status** | BETA - Needs Work (Not production-ready) |
| **Overall Risk** | MEDIUM (Data loss potential, multi-user issues) |
| **Real-Time Performance** | Acceptable (400-700ms latency) |
| **Transcription Accuracy** | 80-97% (varies by API choice) |
| **Critical Issues** | 3 (must fix before production) |
| **High Priority Issues** | 5 (do before launch) |
| **Minor Issues** | 4 (nice to have) |

---

## Key Findings Summary

### Critical Issues (Must Fix)
1. **Missing Lyrics Organization Endpoint** (4-6 hours to fix)
   - Frontend calls `/api/v1/ai/organize-lyrics` which doesn't exist
   - Feature silently fails

2. **WebSocket Not Per-User** (8-10 hours to fix)
   - Global shared connection across all clients
   - Risk of transcription cross-contamination

3. **No Web Speech API Fallback** (6-10 hours to fix)
   - No automatic switch to Whisper if recognition crashes
   - Data loss potential

### High Priority Issues (Do Before Launch)
4. English-only language support
5. No confidence score tracking
6. Inaccurate segment timestamps (±1 second error)
7. Hardcoded VAD settings (no user tuning)
8. Limited error handling (5 unhandled scenarios)

## Architecture Overview

### Dual-Path Transcription System

**Path 1: FreestyleSession (Web Speech API)**
```
Browser Mic → Web Speech Recognition → Real-time interim + final results 
→ LyricsSegments → LyricsWidget display → Manual save
```
- **Latency:** 400-700ms total
- **Accuracy:** 80-92%
- **Cost:** Free
- **Best for:** Demos, offline usage

**Path 2: RealtimeVoiceWidget (OpenAI Whisper)**
```
Browser Mic → PCM16 24kHz → WebSocket → Backend → OpenAI Realtime API 
→ Transcription event → Socket.IO emit → Display
```
- **Latency:** 300-650ms total
- **Accuracy:** 92-97%
- **Cost:** $0.006/min
- **Best for:** Production, high accuracy

**Shared Display Layer:** LyricsWidget component
- Position configurable
- Real-time scrolling
- Edit/export capabilities
- Timestamp tracking (optional)

## Recommended Action Plan

### Immediate (Week 1)
1. Read TRANSCRIPTION_AUDIT_SUMMARY.txt
2. Review critical issues section
3. Plan Priority 1 fixes (15-20 hours total)

### Short Term (Week 2)
1. Implement `/api/v1/ai/organize-lyrics` endpoint
2. Fix WebSocket per-user isolation
3. Add confidence score tracking

### Medium Term (Week 3-4)
1. Add multi-language support
2. Implement Whisper fallback
3. Fix segment timestamp accuracy

### Long Term (Backlog)
1. Session recovery with IndexedDB
2. Additional export formats
3. Search functionality

---

## Risk Assessment

### 🔴 High Risk (Address Immediately)
- **Shared WebSocket:** Potential data cross-contamination across users
- **Missing API:** Orphaned frontend code with failing gracefully
- **No Fallback:** Session crash during Web Speech failure = data loss

### 🟡 Medium Risk (Before Launch)
- **Inconsistent Timestamps:** Breaks lyric-to-beat alignment
- **English-Only:** Excludes non-English user base
- **Limited Error Handling:** Poor UX on system failures

### 🟢 Low Risk (Nice to Have)
- **Limited Export Formats:** Minor UX issue
- **No Versioning:** Standard for web apps
- **No Search:** Usability pain point only

---

## Integration Points

**Frontend ↔ Backend:**
- REST API: `/api/v1/ai/organize-lyrics` (NOT IMPLEMENTED)
- Socket.IO: Real-time transcription streaming
- HTTP: Audio upload and project management

**Frontend ↔ Speech APIs:**
- Web Speech API: Native browser speech recognition
- OpenAI Realtime: WebSocket streaming transcription

**Backend ↔ External Services:**
- OpenAI Whisper: Speech-to-text transcription
- OpenAI Realtime API: Real-time voice chat
- OpenAI GPT-4: Lyrics organization (not called)

---

## Testing Recommendations

### Critical Test Cases
```
Test 1: Record 5-minute freestyle session
  Expected: Real-time lyrics display, no crashes
  
Test 2: Web Speech API failure recovery
  Expected: Automatic switch to Whisper (NOT IMPLEMENTED)
  
Test 3: Multi-user concurrent recording
  Expected: Separate transcriptions per user (FAILS - shared WebSocket)
  
Test 4: Lyrics organization after recording
  Expected: AI-organized verse/chorus structure (ENDPOINT MISSING)
```

### Missing Test Coverage
- End-to-end freestyle recording
- Real-time transcription accuracy comparison
- WebSocket isolation (multi-user scenarios)
- Error recovery workflows
- Audio format conversion failures
- Microphone permission edge cases
