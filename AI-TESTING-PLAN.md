# ü§ñ AI Agent Testing Plan - DAWG AI

**Status:** Ready for Approval
**Created:** 2025-10-16
**Framework:** Claude Sonnet 4.5 + Playwright

---

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive AI-powered testing strategy for DAWG AI using specialized AI agents to meticulously test every component from atoms to organisms.

### Testing Philosophy

**Atomic Design Testing:** Each component level is tested by specialized AI agents that understand the context and purpose of that level.

**AI-Powered Analysis:** Claude Sonnet 4.5 analyzes screenshots, DOM structure, and behavior to identify:
- Functionality issues
- UI/UX problems
- Accessibility violations
- AI integration failures
- Edge cases
- Enhancement opportunities

## Testing Methodology

### For Each Component:

1. **Visual Inspection**
   - AI agent captures screenshot
   - Analyzes layout, spacing, colors, typography
   - Checks for visual bugs (overlap, alignment, contrast)

2. **Functional Testing**
   - Locates element via selector or text
   - Tests interaction (click, type, hover)
   - Verifies expected behavior
   - Checks console for errors

3. **Accessibility Audit**
   - Keyboard navigation
   - Screen reader support
   - ARIA attributes
   - Color contrast
   - Focus indicators

4. **AI Analysis**
   - Claude analyzes component in context
   - Identifies UX improvements
   - Suggests optimizations
   - Flags potential bugs
   - Recommends enhancements

5. **Findings Documentation**
   - Status: pass/fail/warning/enhancement
   - Severity: critical/high/medium/low
   - Category: functionality/ui/accessibility/ai/performance
   - Evidence: screenshots, console logs, DOM state
   - Recommendation: specific fix or improvement

---

## Expected Findings Format

Each agent will produce findings like:

```json
{
  "component": "New Project Button",
  "level": "atom",
  "status": "warning",
  "severity": "medium",
  "category": "accessibility",
  "issue": "Button lacks accessible name for screen readers",
  "evidence": [
    "aria-label attribute is missing",
    "No visible text inside button",
    "Icon-only button without label"
  ],
  "recommendation": "Add aria-label='Create new project' to button element",
  "aiAnalysis": "While the button is functional and visually clear, users relying on assistive technology may not understand its purpose. Adding an accessible name would improve inclusivity."
}
```
